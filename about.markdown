I am a computer science student whose hobby is studying artificial intelligence. This site was created as a kind of blog where I can write a little about my experience in artificial intelligence. The posts here will focus on applications of artificial intelligence algorithms to real-world problems, with a little explanation of how each of these algorithms works.

You can find the source code for these projects at my [Github](https://github.com/jadsonlucio)
